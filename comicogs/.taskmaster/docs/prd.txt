# Comicogs Product Requirements Document (PRD)
> **Version:** 1.1  
> **Authors:** Jarrett West (Product Lead), Sofie (AI Partner)  
> **Last Updated:** 2025-07-12  

## 1 | Vision & Value Proposition
Comicogs will be the crowd-curated database + peer-to-peer marketplace + collector toolset for physical comic books, modeled on Discogs' three-part flywheel:
- **Open Database** – users add/verify issues, variants, printings
- **Marketplace** – every catalogued item can be bought or sold
- **Collection/Wantlist** – collectors track holdings & grails, driving repeat visits

Comicogs' differentiators vs. Discogs:
- AI cover-scan to auto-match & grade issues
- Full price graph (not 30-sale cap) plus external data (eBay, Heritage)
- Escrow + shipping-damage insurance (trust layer eBay lacks)
- Mobile, camera-first UX with barcode/cover scanning baked in

## 2 | User Segments

|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Casual Reader | Identify & value attic box | No single app, valuation confusing |
| Hardcore Collector | Complete runs, monitor prices | Tracking variants & sales across sites |
| Comic Shop / Dealer | List 1k+ comics, bulk ship | Manual listing, inconsistent grading |
| Flipper/Speculator | Scan, list, sell fast | High eBay fees, low metadata quality |
