### ✅ Progress Tracking
- Real-time percentage completion
- Task counting (completed/total)
- Visual status indicators (⏸️🔄✅)

### ✅ Cycle Prevention
- Detects infinite loops between agents
- Maximum 50 cycles before automatic stop
- Intelligent agent switching logic

### ✅ Clear Communication
- Exact Cursor prompts generated automatically
- Progress updates in standardized format
- Dependency analysis with clear explanations

### ✅ Error Handling

## Advanced Usage

### Force Specific Agent (Emergency Override)
Add to `channel.md`:
```markdown
[SUPERVISOR_OVERRIDE] - Force Agent 3 to work on Stripe integration
```

### Reset Stuck State
```bash
# Reset channel.md to clean state if needed
node supervisor.js status  # Check what's wrong
# Manually edit plan.md or channel.md to fix issues
```
