# Agent 4: Search & Data Engineer

## 🎯 Current Mission
Build powerful search functionality and data processing systems for comic discovery.

## ✅ Checklist - Phase 1
- [ ] Wait for Agent 1 to complete basic schema
- [ ] Research search solution (Elasticsearch vs PostgreSQL full-text vs alternatives)
- [ ] Plan data indexing strategy for comics catalog
- [ ] Design search API endpoints and filtering system
- [ ] Create autocomplete and suggestion algorithms
- [ ] Plan recommendation engine architecture
- [ ] Design analytics data collection system
- [ ] Create data normalization pipeline for comic metadata

## 📋 Dependencies
**Waiting for**: Agent 1 (database schema), Agent 3 (marketplace search requirements)
**Blocking**: Agent 2 (needs search component specs)

## 🔍 Search Specifications
- **Full-text Search**: Comic titles, series, publishers, creators
- **Filters**: Publisher, year range, condition, price range, availability
- **Sorting**: Relevance, price (low/high), date added, popularity
- **Autocomplete**: Real-time suggestions for titles and creators
- **Recommendations**: "Similar comics" and personalized suggestions

## 🗒️ Technical Notes
- Start with PostgreSQL full-text search for MVP, plan Elasticsearch migration
- Implement proper search indexing and query optimization
- Create caching layer for frequently searched terms
- Design analytics tracking for search behavior
- Plan for scalable data ingestion and processing

## 📤 Handoffs
When I complete my Phase 1 tasks:
- Provide Agent 2 with search component requirements and APIs
- Coordinate with Agent 3 for marketplace-specific search features
- Work with Agent 5 for search performance monitoring
