## Usage Instructions

### For Development
When using `/shadcn-plan [feature-description]`:
1. Replace this template content with actual implementation plan
2. Include detailed component breakdown
3. Map all requirements to shadcn primitives
4. Specify custom component needs
5. Add accessibility checklist
6. Include performance considerations

### For Manual Planning
1. Copy this template to a new file: `design/implementation-[feature].md`
2. Fill out each section with specific requirements
3. Reference shadcn MCP server for component APIs
4. Include mockups or ASCII layouts if helpful
5. Add implementation timeline and dependencies

### After Implementation
1. Update status checkboxes as components are completed
2. Document any deviations from the original plan
3. Add performance metrics and accessibility test results
4. Include lessons learned for future implementations
