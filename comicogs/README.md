## 🏗️ Multi-Agent Development System

This project features an innovative **5-agent development system** that coordinates specialized AI agents:

1. **Agent 1: Infrastructure & API Lead** - Database, authentication, API routes
2. **Agent 2: Frontend & UI/UX Developer** - Components, styling, user experience  
3. **Agent 3: Marketplace & Business Logic** - E-commerce, payments, transactions
4. **Agent 4: Search & Data Engineer** - Search algorithms, recommendations
5. **Agent 5: DevOps & Quality Engineer** - Testing, deployment, monitoring

### Getting Started with Multi-Agent Development

```bash
# Run the supervisor to coordinate agents
node supervisor.js start

# Check current status
node supervisor.js status

## 📊 Development Workflow

### Using the Multi-Agent System

1. **Check Status**: `node supervisor.js status`
2. **Get Next Agent**: `node supervisor.js next`
3. **Follow Agent Instructions**: Copy the generated prompt to your AI assistant
4. **Update Progress**: Agents update `channel.md` and `plan.md`
5. **Coordinate Handoffs**: System automatically manages dependencies

### Manual Development

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Make changes following the existing patterns
3. Run tests: `npm test`
4. Commit with conventional commits: `git commit -m "feat: add new feature"`
5. Push and create PR: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
