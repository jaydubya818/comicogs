📋 VERCEL CONFIGURATION STEPS:

🎯 OPTION 1: Set Root Directory (Recommended)
Go to your Vercel Dashboard → comicogs-01 → Settings → General
Set 'Root Directory' to: frontend

🎯 OPTION 2: Alternative vercel.json approach
Keep Root Directory as '.' but use this vercel.json:

{
  "buildCommand": "cd frontend && npm run build",
  "devCommand": "cd frontend && npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "cd frontend && npm install",
  "outputDirectory": "frontend/.next"
}

📝 CURRENT STATUS:
Your vercel.json is now simplified. You need to set the Root Directory in Vercel Dashboard.
