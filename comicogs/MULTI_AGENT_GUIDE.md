# 🤖 Comicogs Multi-Agent Development Kit

## Overview

This setup creates a collaborative AI development system where 5 specialized agents work together to build a comic book marketplace. Each agent has specific responsibilities and clear communication protocols.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run the Setup Script
```bash
# Create a new project directory
mkdir my-comicogs-project
cd my-comicogs-project

# Run the setup script
bash /path/to/setup-multi-agent.sh
```

### 2. Open in Cursor
```bash
# Open the project in Cursor
cursor .
```

### 3. Start with Agent 1
Copy this prompt into Cursor:
```
@cursor Act as Agent 1. Read the supervisor.md file and your agent_1.md file. Check channel.md for status. Begin with your first task: Create Next.js 14 project. Update channel.md when you start and finish.
```

## 🤖 Agent Roles & Responsibilities

### Agent 1: Infrastructure & API Lead
**Focus**: Database, authentication, API architecture
**First Tasks**: 
- Create Next.js 14 project
- Set up Prisma ORM
- Install NextAuth.js
- Create basic schema

### Agent 2: Frontend & UI/UX Developer
**Focus**: User interface, components, responsive design
**First Tasks**:
- Install shadcn/ui
- Configure Tailwind theme
- Create layout components
- Set up routing

### Agent 3: Marketplace & Business Logic
**Focus**: E-commerce functionality, payments, business rules
**First Tasks**:
- Wait for Agent 1's schema
- Plan marketplace workflows
- Design Stripe integration

### Agent 4: Search & Data Engineer
**Focus**: Search functionality, data processing, recommendations
**First Tasks**:
- Research search solutions
- Plan data indexing
- Design search API

### Agent 5: DevOps & Quality Engineer
**Focus**: CI/CD, testing, deployment, monitoring
**First Tasks**:
- Set up GitHub Actions
- Create Docker config
- Plan testing strategy

## 🔄 Workflow Process

### 1. Check Dependencies
Always read `channel.md` first to see:
- Current agent status
- What's been completed
- What's blocked
- Who should work next

### 2. Work as One Agent
- Focus only on your assigned agent role
- Complete tasks from your checklist
- Don't work on other agents' responsibilities

### 3. Communicate Progress
Update `channel.md` using this format:
```
[Agent X] - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - Brief action
Details: What was done
→ next: What should happen next
```

### 4. Hand Off Clearly
Signal when other agents can begin:
- Agent 1 → Agent 2 (after project setup)
- Agent 1 → Agent 3 (after database schema)
- Agent 2 → Agent 3 (after UI components)

## 📊 Dependencies Map

```
Agent 1 (Infrastructure)
    ↓
Agent 2 (Frontend) ← → Agent 5 (DevOps)
    ↓                    ↑
Agent 3 (Marketplace) ← Agent 4 (Search)
```

**Critical Path**: Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] Next.js project runs locally
- [ ] Database schema is created
- [ ] Basic authentication works
- [ ] UI components are functional
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is running

### Ready for Production When:
- [ ] All marketplace features work
- [ ] Search functionality is implemented
- [ ] Payment processing is secure
- [ ] Testing suite passes
- [ ] Deployment is automated

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js (GitHub/Google)
- **UI**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Search**: Elasticsearch (planned)
- **Testing**: Jest + Playwright
- **Deployment**: Vercel → AWS ECS

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Effective Multi-Agent Development:
1. **Read before writing** - Always check channel.md first
2. **Stay in your lane** - Focus on your agent's expertise
3. **Communicate clearly** - Use the exact format for updates
4. **Test as you go** - Ensure handoffs work properly
5. **Document decisions** - Update your agent file with notes

### Common Patterns:
- **Starting work**: "Beginning [task] - checking dependencies"
- **Completing work**: "Finished [task] - ready for handoff"
- **Blocked**: "Waiting for Agent X to complete [dependency]"
- **Handoff**: "Agent Y can now begin [specific task]"

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If agents conflict:
1. Check the dependencies map
2. Verify who should be working
3. Update plan.md if priorities changed
4. Use channel.md to resolve conflicts

### If handoffs fail:
1. Ensure prerequisites are actually complete
2. Check communication format was used correctly
3. Verify files/features work as expected
4. Re-read agent mission statements

### If stuck:
1. Review your agent's checklist
2. Check what other agents have completed
3. Look for unblocked tasks you can work on
4. Ask for help in channel.md

## 📈 Scaling the System

This multi-agent approach can be extended for larger projects:
- Add more specialized agents (Security, Performance, etc.)
- Create sub-teams for complex features
- Implement automated testing for agent handoffs
- Add integration with project management tools
